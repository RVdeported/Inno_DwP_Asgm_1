The repository is created for Assignment 1 on Design for python course in Innopolis University.

The main.py file is designed to demonstrate different decorators in files task_*.py along with few custom functions as specified in the assignment description.
The program creates 3 additional .txt files for demonstration of stdout redirection and error log implementation.

Please note, that @decorator form is used only on first function for demonstration of my understanding of a concept. In the rest examples I used 'func_* = decorator(func)' to avoid coping the function each time I want to change decorator. If such style of implementation is not acceptable, please contact me and I will sent a version with @decorator style only.

The code can be further cleaned up to better fit coding standards and ease the maintenance of the code (i.e., few sub-functions can be created as routines are used few times. Also, functions do not really check whether input parameters are valid). However, for aims of assignment, I did not go through such hustle. In case that affects my final mark, please contact me and I will correct the such issues.

Thank you,
